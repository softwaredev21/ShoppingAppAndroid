# ShopApp for Android
ShopApp connects with popular ecommerce platforms like Shopify, Magento, BigCommerce, and WooCommerce to transfer them into a mobile app for iOS and Android.
So far, we’ve developed a [Shopify provider for Android](https://github.com/rubygarage/shopapp-shopify-android) and [Shopify provider for iOS](https://github.com/rubygarage/shopapp-shopify-ios).
Currently we’re working on adding more providers and extending the features list, so stay in touch with our updates.

## Installation
To install the dependencies required for an application build, ShopApp uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org). Connect one of the providers for an online store and install all the dependencies. As an example, let's use Shopify.

1. Add the following line to **app/build.gradle**:
```
implementation "com.github.rubygarage:shopapp-shopify-android:1.0.4"
```

Also, you'll have to configure the provider to get an access to your online store. To configure the provider, follow the instructions on a provider's page <link>. For a Shopify provider, the flow is following:

2. Add the following code: 
```
val api = ShopifyApi(this, "BASE DOMAIN", "STOREFRONT ACCESS TOKEN", "API KEY", "API PASSWORD") //Initialize your api here. 
appComponent = buildAppComponent(api, dao)
```
to the file **app/src/main/java/com/shopapp/ShopApplication.kt**. 

3. You'll also have to configure the provider to receive an access to your store. To get an access, follow the instructions on a provider's page. 

Check out how to configure the [Shopify provider](https://github.com/rubygarage/shopapp-shopify-android).

4. After that, you'll be able to open the project file and launch an app.

To create a client for another SaaS provider, you have to add the following dependency to the dependencies:
```
implementation 'com.github.rubygarage:shopapp-android:1.0.5'
```

5. Next, create a class that'll interact with the main application and implement the API interface. 

6. After that you'll be able to add a new client to the main application: <link>
